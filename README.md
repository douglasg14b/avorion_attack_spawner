# Pirate and Alien(soon) Attack Spawner
### v1.0

Allows you to spawn waves of pirates (aliens coming soon) of various difficulties. 

## Usage
`/spawnpirates {difficulty}`

Difficulty ranges from 1-11. So if you wanted to span a wave with a difficulty of 5, you would type in `/spawnpirates 5`

- Spawn wave on specific player
