# Pirate and Alien(soon) Attack Spawner
### v1.0

Allows you to spawn waves of pirates (aliens coming soon) of various difficulties. 
## Installation

Copy the files into the folders as they are listed in the repository. You may need to create the `cmd` folder under your `player` directory. You can find these directories under your `Avorion` installation folder, under `Avorion/data`
- `scripts/commands/spawnpirates.lua`
- `scripts/player/cmd/spawnpirates.lua`

## Usage
`/spawnpirates {difficulty}`

Difficulty ranges from 1-11. So if you wanted to span a wave with a difficulty of 5, you would type in `/spawnpirates 5`

### Planned

- Alien Spawning
- Dynamic difficulty levels (not hardcoded)
- Spawn wave on specific player
